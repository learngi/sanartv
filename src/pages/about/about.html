        MicroArt is not something I produce, it's something that produces a change in me and my clients. When you see my Art, I think
        you'll agree. I am also a passionate artist, engineer, photographer who is well known for his miniature/micro art
        carvings on pencil lead and robotics works

         MICRO-ART ON LEAD Sparking conversations and inspiring the curvature on lead, with a memory that cannot
        be forgotten, and must be personally experienced. MINIATURE Harnessing creativity and perfecting the craft with practical
        experience. SCULPTURES Home Decores, I'm only as good as my Choice. WALL-ART, PAINTING & PHOTOGRAPHY Seeing what
        other photographers,paintings won't, capturing what others can't.
